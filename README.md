# NHS tutorials for accessing ECCC hydrometeorological prediciton data

This repository includes tutorials and examples that aim to support the National Hydrological Services (NHS) and its partners in discovering, accessing and applying numerical hydro-meteorological prediction products from Environment and Climate Canada (ECCC) in practical applications.  

Our goal is to cover a variety of ECCC prediction products, defined as past (reanalyses), present (analyses or now-casts) and future (forecasts), as well as the various dissemination platforms and formats that allow end-users to access these products.  Additionally, we aim to include examples using various programming languages, GIS applications, and other tools, depending on user-needs.   

As these tutorials and examples are actively being developed, updated and improved, we would welcome your feedback and invite you to return as these continue to evolve.
